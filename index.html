              Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
              efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
              approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax
              and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it
              an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
              in many areas on most platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are
              freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms
              from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be
              freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of
              and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and
              tools, and additional documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and
              data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable
              from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for
              customizable applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic
              concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps
              to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but
              all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read
              off-line as well.

          <h1>Exceptions</h1>
          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>
              Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may
              cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors
              detected during execution are called exceptions and are not
              unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in
              Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs,
              however, and result in error messages as shown here:
            </p>
            <p>
              The last line of the error message indicates what happened.
              Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as
              part of the message: the types in the example are
              ZeroDivisionError, NameError and TypeError. The string printed as
              the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that
              occurred. This is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not
              be true for user-defined exceptions (although it is a useful
              convention). Standard exception names are built-in identifiers
              (not reserved keywords).
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions.
              Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until
              a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt
              the program (using Control-C or whatever the operating system
              supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by
              raising the KeyboardInterrupt exception.
            </p>
            <p>
              A try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify
              handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler will be
              executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the
              corresponding try clause, not in other handlers of the same try
              statement. An except clause may name multiple exceptions as a
              parenthesized tuple, for example:
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>
              Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception
              class (see Classes for more about Python classes). Exceptions
              should typically be derived from the Exception class, either
              directly or indirectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class
              can do, but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number
              of attributes that allow information about the error to be
              extracted by handlers for the exception. When creating a module
              that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to
              create a base class for exceptions defined by that module, and
              subclass that to create specific exception classes for different
              error conditions:
            </p>
            <p>
              Most exceptions are defined with names that end in “Error”,
              similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many standard modules define their own exceptions to report errors
              that may occur in functions they define. More information on
              classes is presented in chapter Classes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>
              The try statement has another optional clause which is intended to
              define clean-up actions that must be executed under all
              circumstances. For example:
            </p>
            <p>
              If a finally clause is present, the finally clause will execute as
              the last task before the try statement completes. The finally
              clause runs whether or not the try statement produces an
              exception. The following points discuss more complex cases when an
              exception occurs:
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see, the finally clause is executed in any event. The
              TypeError raised by dividing two strings is not handled by the
              except clause and therefore re-raised after the finally clause has
              been executed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In real world applications, the finally clause is useful for
              releasing external resources (such as files or network
              connections), regardless of whether the use of the resource was
              successful.
